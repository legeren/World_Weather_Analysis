# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the world weather analysis: 
This assignment consists of three deliverables.  
1. Retrieve weather data 
2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Results: 
The following summarizes the steps followed to provide the deliverables for this assignment.

- Generate a set of 2,000 random latitude and longitudes, then retrieve the nearest city and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap
- Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify vacation spots and nearby hotels
- Use Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between 4 cities chosen based on customer's possible travel destinations
    

## Summary: 
In summary, following the steps for this assignment, the ultimate end result was a travel itinerary on a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary based on the customer's weather preferences.  

A limitation for this travel itinerary is that google travel mode is limited to "driving", "bicycling" or "walking".  Thus, travel itinerary crossing oceans was not possible.
